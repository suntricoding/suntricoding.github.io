:::info  

- Antivirus can remove most malware, but it can't fix all the damage done to the system. For instance, malware may infect system files, corrupt Windows updates, alter important registries, or hide in places undetectable by antimalware. Antivirus cannot fix those issues.

- Due to this reason, in the event of a malware infection, you must perform a [clean installation of the system](https://gravesoft.dev/clean_install_windows) using a bootable USB drive and formatting the C drive and EFI/System partitions. (Do not use the reset option, malware can persist in that case.)
